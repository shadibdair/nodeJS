# IDE VS Text-Editor

* *IDE* - An `integrated development environment` is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.    
An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Most modern IDEs have intelligent code completion. Some IDEs, such as `visual studio`, contain a compiler, interpreter, or both;,do not. 
    * IDE takes a lot of memory in the local computer
    * Normally a single IDE serves only specific languages
    * Very easy to use, and comes with built-in options to run the code
    * IDE comes to specific operation systems
*  *Text-Editor* - various tools to simplify the construction of a graphical user interface (GUI).    
such as: `notepad++`, `visual studio code`
    * Text editor is light weight for the local computer
    * Can serve all the languages
    * Does not come with built-in options to run the code (we need to run from the cli - `command line interface`)
    * cross operation systems
